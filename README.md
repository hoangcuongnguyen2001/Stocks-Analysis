# Stocks-Analysis
This is my Python model to analyse stocks in Nasdaq (Tesla, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon) based on the past 5 years' data. 
My special thanks is to Eduardo Garcia and his note (<https://medium.com/@eduardo.garcia.sv/if-you-dont-have-any-idea-how-to-create-a-stock-portfolio-this-will-help-you-99efc92cd4d5>) to provide this idea to me.
